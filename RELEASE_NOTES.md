# pyrtcm Release Notes

### RELEASE 1.1.9

FIXES:

1. Fix BEIDOU_SIG_MAP in rtcmtables.py Fixes #85

### RELEASE 1.1.8

1. Address issue [#82](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyrtcm/issues/82).

### RELEASE 1.1.7

1. Internal streamlining of RTCMReader - no functional changes.

### RELEASE 1.1.6

1. Proposed SSR Stage 1 and 2 message definitions added (1240-1264) - thanks to @davidtlascelles for contribution.

### RELEASE 1.1.5

1. Minor internal performance enhancements.
1. DF071 field definition updated.
1. Test cases enhanced.

### RELEASE 1.1.4

1. Refine handling of string attributes (e.g. DF140, DF563, DF566).
1. Add optional 'parsed' argument to RTCMReader - 1 = return raw and parsed data, 0 = return only raw data (parsed will be None)
2. Temporarily suppress 1302 test cases **NB:** sample 1302 messages from euref-ip.net:2101/EUREF01 appear to be truncated (to 59 bytes), causing a `ValueError - negative shift count` exception; this mountpoint also causes the BNC 2.13.1 NTRIP client to bomb every time, so possibly an issue with the source implementation or documentation???

### RELEASE 1.1.3

1. Update RTCM message definitions - messages 1300-1305 added.

### RELEASE 1.0.17

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add proprietary IGS SSR 4076 messages, as defined in https://files.igs.org/pub/data/format/igs_ssr_v1.pdf. NB not fully tested as available NTRIP sources only cover a subset of the 4076 subtypes defined.

2. MSM Extended Satellite Information field parsed into appropriate datafield e.g. DF419 for GLONASS, ExtSatInfo for other GNSS.

### RELEASE 1.0.14

CHANGES:

1. Minor internal streamlining of RTCM 1230 message processing.

### RELEASE 1.0.13

ENHANCEMENTS:

FIXES:

1. Fix incorrect DF454 datafield length - thanks to @k-stf for contribution. Fixes #37

### RELEASE 1.0.9

### RELEASE 1.0.0

CHANGES:

1. Marked to v1.0.0.
2. shields.io build status badge URL updated. 

No functional changes

### RELEASE 0.3.1

CHANGES:

1. Logging removed - Fixes #12.

### RELEASE 0.3.0

CHANGES:

1. Setup status changed to Production/Stable.
2. `pyserial` dependency removed.

### RELEASE 0.2.9-beta

FIXES:

1. `cell2prn` routine in `rtcmhelpers.py` corrected for 1117 and 1127 MSM message types.

### RELEASE 0.2.8-beta

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. New optional keyword argument `labelmsm` added to `read()` and `parse()` methods. Defaults to `True`. When True, attributes within MSM NSAT and NCELL repeating groups are labelled with their corresponding satellite PRN and signal ID when the `__str__()` (`print()`) method is invoked - e.g. `DF405_10(014,2C)` signifies that the the 10th `DF405` attribute in the group refers to satellite PRN 014 and signal ID 2C (*in RINEX notation*). 
2. **NB** this only affects the string (print) representation of the RTCMMessage - the underlying payload and attribute names are unchanged.

### RELEASE 0.2.7-beta

FIXES:

1. MSM group name definitions updated (was preventing some MSM attributes from rendering). All MSM message types (1077, 1127, etc.) should now render properly.

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add helper method `cell2prn` and associated lookup tables to map MSM cells (DF405_01, DF405_02, etc.) to their corresponding satellite PRNs and signal IDs.

### RELEASE 0.2.6-beta

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add capability to read from TCP/UDP socket as well as serial stream. Utilises a SocketStream utility class to allow sockets to be read using standard stream-like read(bytes) and readline() methods.

### RELEASE 0.2.5-beta

CHANGES:

1. Remove support for Python 3.6, now end of life (should still work find on 3.6 but no longer actively tested on this version).

FIXES:

1. Add CRC validation to RTCMReader.parse() method.

### RELEASE 0.2.4-beta

FIXES:

1. Fixed occasional parse error in some 1127 (MSM7) messages (some NTRIP casters appear to send truncated 1127 messages in certain circumstances).

### RELEASE 0.2.3-beta

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Additional Ephemerides message types added - 1041, 1042, 1044, 1045, 1046. `pyrtcm` should now support the full range of non-proprietary message types documented in RTCM 10403.3 (aka v3.3) with Amendment 2 - 2021-SC104-1217.
3. Minor enhancements to data field and message type descriptions.
2. `ntripclient.py` example enhanced and simplified.

### RELEASE 0.2.2-beta

FIXES:

1. Fixed error in RTCMReader.parse_buffer() which caused IndexError in certain circumstances. Apologies, previous fix was inadequate.

### RELEASE 0.2.1-beta

FIXES:

1. Fixed error in RTCMReader.parse_buffer() which caused IndexError in certain circumstances.

### RELEASE 0.2.0-beta

CHANGES:

1. Added `parse_buffer()` static method to `RTCMReader` to parse an individual RTCM3 message from a buffer
containing whole or partial RTCM3 messages, and return any remaining buffer. Can be used to parse the output from an NTRIP server HTTP GET response, for example. Thanks to @jakepoz and @foxittt for suggestion & inspiration.
2. Add simple NTRIP client example `ntripclient.py` which uses the new method above.
3. Development status updated to beta

### RELEASE 0.1.8-alpha

CHANGES:

1. Scaling now applied by default (`scaling=True`)

### RELEASE 0.1.7-alpha

CHANGES:

1. RTCMMessage constructor uses keyword argument for payload for consistency with other SEMU GNSS libraries, i.e.:
```python
msg = RTCMMessage(payload=b">\xd0\x00\x03\x8aX\xd9I<\x87/4\x10\x9d\x07\xd6\xafH ")
```
rather than:
```python
msg = RTCMMessage(b">\xd0\x00\x03\x8aX\xd9I<\x87/4\x10\x9d\x07\xd6\xafH ")
```

2. `scaling` boolean keyword argument added to `RTCMReader` and `RTCMMessage` constructors and `RTCMReader.parse()` method to turn attribute scaling on or off. Defaults to False (no scaling) during current alpha testing (*refer to Sphinx API documentation for usage*); will default to True in final version once the correct scaling factors have been verified (the RTCM 10403.n standard itself does not appear to state the applied scaling factors explicitly, but only indirectly via the 'resolution' parameter).

### RELEASE 0.1.6-alpha

FIXES:

1. Fix several grouped payload definitions for 1001-1004, 1009-1012, 1015-1017, 1021-1022, 1037-1039.

### RELEASE 0.1.5-alpha

FIXES:

1. Fix typo in payload definitions containing DF149.

### RELEASE 0.1.4-alpha

FIXES:

1. Fix 1013 message payload definition.
2. Fix nested group handling for messages 1059 & 1065.

### RELEASE 0.1.3-alpha

1. Additional message types added (message types 1020 - 1068).

### RELEASE 0.1.2-alpha

1. MSM (Multiple Signal Messages) message definitions & handling added (message types 1071 - 1127).

### RELEASE 0.1.1-alpha

1. Initial Alpha release. Core parsing functionality is reasonably solid, but only a limited number of message types are currently implemented and tested. In theory, missing types simply require appropriate definitions added to the `RTCM_PAYLOADS_GET` dictionary in `rtcmtypes_get.py` (** subject to further testing **).
2. In the meantime, `pyrtcm2` will return `<RTCM(nnnn, DF002=nnnn, status=Not_Yet_Implemented)>` for any RTCM messages types not yet defined.

### RELEASE 0.1.0-alpha

1. Initial release
